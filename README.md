<h2 style="color:#1267fc"> Setup </h2>
Some settings must be performed before running the project,
These settings could be centralized in a general .env to make it easier, but at this point I thought it best

<h3 style="color:#1267fc"> Running the project </h3>
The frontend system can be accessed by logging in <code>http://localhost:3001</code>. In addition to the front end, we have other links that can be accessed such as the api documentation that can be accessed by the link <code>http://localhost:3678/doc</code> and the link <code>http://localhost :3678/files/urlImage</code> which is used to access images by changing the word urlImage to the name of the image registered in the database. Also in the <code>package.json</code> file there are some commands to run the automated test and update the documentation.
